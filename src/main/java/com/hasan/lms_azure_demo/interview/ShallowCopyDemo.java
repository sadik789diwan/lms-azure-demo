/**
 * In Java, a shallow copy copies fields as they are (primitive values and object references), so nested objects are shared.
 * A deep copy not only copies the main object but also creates new copies of nested objects, ensuring full independence.
 * Shallow copy can be done via super.clone(), whereas deep copy requires overriding clone(), using a copy constructor, or using serialization.
